\section{Introduction}\label{sec-intro}


\todo{Narrow down to a topic; Dig a hole; Fill the hole}



\gangli{``narrow in on topic'' reminds you 
that readers and reviewers only know that this is a AI or HTM research paper (and maybe have read the title/abstract). 
You need to help them figure out what topic and area of research paper this is. 
You _don't_ need to wax poetic about the topic's importance.}

\gangli{`dig a hole'' reminds you that 
you need to convince the reader that there's a problem with the state of the world. 
Prior work may exist but it's either missing something important or there's a missing opportunity. 
The reader should be drooling for a bright future just out of reach.}

\gangli{
``fill the hole'' reminds you to show the reader 
how and why the paper they're reading will fix these problems and deliver us into a better place. 
You don't need a whirlwind summary of the technical details, 
but you need readers convinced (and in a good mood) to keep reading.}
